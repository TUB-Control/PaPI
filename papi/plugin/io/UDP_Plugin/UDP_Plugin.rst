UDP_Plugin
===============


.. topic:: General description

    This plugin provides an UDP-Interface commonly used to connect PaPI with Simulink or ORTD.
    The plugin will generate output blocks dynamically based on the connected source.
    Parameter are determined by the source as well.

    After the plugin is started, it will try to connect to the source (determined by the ip address) and awaits a info
    about the required parameter and blocks.

Output
-----------
Variable, depend on source


Dependencies
-----------

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip3 install socketIO-client

The plugin also uses python json and socket (should be available in every default installation)


Configuration
----------------------
The plugin configuration documentation is given as a tooltip in the plugin create menu for the UDP plugin.

Parameter
----------------------
There is just one static parameter: consoleIN. This parameter can be used to tunnel console commands to the source in case
the source supports such an input (example: node.js target-server with scilab console).
Other parameters are generated by the source/target.
