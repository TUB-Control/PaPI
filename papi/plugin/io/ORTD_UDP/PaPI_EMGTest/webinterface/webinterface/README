A sample communication interface to ORTD to nodejs using UDP datagrams.  
 
UDPio.sce is a sample ORTD-simulation and webappUDP.js the nodejs program
that connects to this simulation. Further it provides a web-interface 
at http://localhost:8090.

The template for the web-interface is stored in html/main.html.

A recent node.js version is required, I used v0.10.22. Additionally some more packages
are required that can be installed with "npm":

$ npm install socket.io
$ npm install jParser
$ npm install concentrate



To start the set-up start the ORTD-simulation

 $ run_UDPio.sh

in one terminal and
 
 $ node webappUDP.js

in another one. The go to http://localhost:8090
